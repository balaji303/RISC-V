RISC-V is a “reduced instruction set” architecture, and as such, there are not many instructions to learn. In this tutorial, we only use 3 instructions: LA (load absolute address), ADDI (add immediate), and ECALL. The ECALL instruction is used to make a service request to the execution environment. We will only use two calls in our Hello World app, one to “write” and one to “exit”.
